# stoa-algorithms
This is a collection of graph algorithms written in C for the Special Topics on Algorithms course at ISI, Kolkata

# In the unlikely event that someone stumbles across this repo:
These are **sloppy**, **undocumented** and **riddled with errors**, to put it lightly.
They were designed so that they just work on some inputs that I needed them to work on, in
order to not fail the course.
Expect HEAVY REFACTORING once I learn better C and get the time to go through these once again.
